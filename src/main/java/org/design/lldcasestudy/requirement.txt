Step by step framework for designing LLD

1. Gather the requirements
    a. do want desktop application or web application ?
    b. Define the entity for example if asked to design pen ask what is pen is anything that can write is a pen.
    c. Define the physical structure of entity like what is colour of pen, what is size of pen, will have refills?
    d. Type of entity like is it ball pen , gel pen , or marker
    e. Behavior of different type of entity like it writes.
2. Clarifying the requirements
    a. ask about edge cases
3. Use case diagram
4. Class diagram of Entities., Also relation Entity if they are having attributes.
    a. all noun in system
    b. try to visualize the system you will get to know.
5. Schema diagram.
    a. For every clss you see in class diagram create entity for the same and Map every attribute to col of table
    b. for the table exist till now find cardinality of relationship
      i) 1 to 1 relationship you can add col id to either table.
      ii) 1 to m you can add col id to m side.
      iii) m to m better create mapping table.
    c. represent all relation as table
    d. for every mapping table we should also add class for them. (add only those class which has attributes because other would be added by @mapping )
    e.  repeat b to d.
